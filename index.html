            <h2>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for Waste Oil</h2>
            <p>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for Waste Oil refers to a regulatory framework spanning entities dealing with base and lubrication oils to take care of oil waste through a tangible approach. EPR essentially covers stakeholders like production facilities, importers, and recyclers. Earlier, the concept of EPR revolved around plastic, electronic, and battery waste.</p>
            <p>However, after the addition of fresh guidelines to the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2016, the EPR’s applicability extends to waste originating from base and lubrication oils. The said guidelines came into effect on April 1, 2024, compelling entities to register with the Central Pollution Board and start complying with waste management guidelines. The guidelines seek to comprehensively govern oil production and waste generation, ensuring adherence to environmental standards.</p>

            <h2>Legalities Around EPR for Waste Oil</h2>
            <p>The legal framework for EPR for Waste Oil contributes to environmental sustainability by making entities, majorly producers, collection agents, recyclers, and bulk generators manage oil waste based on their role and predefined targets contributing to resource conservation and pollution control.</p>
            <p>EPR mandates municipalities and local bodies to support the said stakeholders in their efforts to minimize pollution and curtail waste generation. Waste oil undergoing the refining process must adhere to the BIS-recommended characteristics.</p>
            <p>Whether undergoing a refining process or storage for disposal, documenting the waste oil supply chain is paramount to staying compliant and transparent. Some other key legalities that stakeholders experience include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adherence to periodic audits</li>
                <li>Mandatory tie-ups with recyclers, disposal facilities, and local bodies for effective waste management</li>
                <li>Complying with predefined targets for waste collection and processing</li>
                <li>Preparing the EPR Action Plan and getting it sanctioned by the concerned authority</li>
                <li>Filing quarterly returns to ensure compliance</li>
            </ul>
